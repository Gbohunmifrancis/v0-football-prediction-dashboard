## Issue: "Sequence contains no elements" Error

### Problem Description
When calling the ML predictions endpoint `GET /api/ml/predictions/gameweek/{gameweek}`, the application crashed with:
```
System.InvalidOperationException: Sequence contains no elements
   at System.Linq.ThrowHelper.ThrowNoElementsException()
   at System.Linq.Enumerable.First[TSource](IEnumerable`1 source)
   at MLPredictionManagerService.GenerateMLGameweekPredictionsAsync(Int32 gameweek) - line 168
```

### Root Cause
The error occurred at line 168 in `MLPredictionManagerService.cs` where the code called `.First()` on an empty `TopPerformers` list. This happened because:
1. The database was still being populated with player data when the API was called
2. No players were available in the database yet
3. The `result.TopPerformers` list was empty, causing `.First()` to throw an exception

### Solution Applied
**File**: `src/FootballPrediction.Infrastructure/Services/MLPredictionManagerService.cs`

**Change**: Added a null/empty check before accessing the first element:

```csharp
// Before (line 168):
_logger.LogInformation("üéØ ML Predictions Complete - Top performer: {TopPlayer} ({Points:F1} pts, {Confidence:P1} confidence)", 
    result.TopPerformers.First().PlayerName, 
    result.TopPerformers.First().PredictedPoints,
    result.TopPerformers.First().Confidence);

// After:
if (result.TopPerformers.Any())
{
    _logger.LogInformation("üéØ ML Predictions Complete - Top performer: {TopPlayer} ({Points:F1} pts, {Confidence:P1} confidence)", 
        result.TopPerformers.First().PlayerName, 
        result.TopPerformers.First().PredictedPoints,
        result.TopPerformers.First().Confidence);
}
else
{
    _logger.LogWarning("‚ö†Ô∏è ML Predictions Complete - No predictions generated. Database may be empty or no eligible players found.");
}
```

### Result
‚úÖ **Fixed**: The application no longer crashes when predictions are requested before data is fully loaded
‚úÖ **Behavior**: 
   - If players exist: Returns predictions with success log
   - If no players exist: Returns empty prediction result with warning log
   - API returns gracefully with appropriate HTTP response

### Recommendation
**Wait for data scraping to complete** before calling ML prediction endpoints. The background job logs show:
- Data scraping is in progress
- Teams, players, and historical performance data are being populated
- This process may take 1-2 minutes on first run

### How to Check if Data is Ready
1. Check the application logs for: `"‚úÖ FPL bootstrap data scraping completed successfully"`
2. Or call the endpoint: `GET /api/players` to see if players are available
3. Monitor Hangfire dashboard if available

### Files Modified
- `src/FootballPrediction.Infrastructure/Services/MLPredictionManagerService.cs` (line 168-177)

### Build Status
‚úÖ Build succeeded
‚úÖ No compilation errors
‚ö†Ô∏è Minor warning: Async method without await (non-critical)
